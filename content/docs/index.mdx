description: Build dynamic documentation with easyâ€”customizable components and designs you can effortlessly integrate into your Next.js apps.

Docsframe is one of the easiest ways to quickly build project documentation without the hassle of starting from scratch.
Built with TypeScript and Next.js, it provides customizable, responsive components tailored for beautiful documentation. Customizable. Open Source.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._

This library is heavily inspired by [https://magicui.design/](https://magicui.design/) and [https://ui.shadcn.com/](https://ui.shadcn.com/) documentation.
