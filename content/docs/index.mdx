**Note:** This is also an instance of Docsframe.

</Callout>

Docsframe is one of the easiest ways to quickly build project documentation without the hassle of starting from scratch.
Built with TypeScript and Next.js, it provides customizable, responsive components tailored for beautiful documentation. Customizable. Open Source.

This is **NOT** just a collection of individual components or a traditional component library. Docsframe is a framework that integrates seamlessly into your Next.js app.

**Why is Docsframe more than a component library?**

Docsframe is designed to integrate seamlessly with your app. By running the CLI, it sets up a ready-to-use documentation system with content collections and customizable components.

No need to build from scratch — it provides the structure and reusable elements you need while keeping the flexibility to make it your own.

*Use Docsframe as a helper to implement, organize, and customize your documentation.*
