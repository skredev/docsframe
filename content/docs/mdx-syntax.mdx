## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX directly in your markdown content. It combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components and embeds them in your content.

## Resources

## Using Components in MDX

Docsframe makes it easy to use custom components in your markdown content. Here's how it works:

<Steps>

### Register your component in `components/docsframe/mdx-components.tsx`:

```tsx
import { MyComponent } from "@/components/docsframe/MyComponent";
// ... other imports

const components = {
  // ... other components
  MyComponent,
};
```

### Then use it directly in your MDX files:

```mdx
<MyComponent>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
</MyComponent>
```
</Steps>

## Built-in Components

Docsframe comes with several [ready-to-use components](/docs/components) that you can use in your MDX files.
