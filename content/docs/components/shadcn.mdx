description: You can implement shadcn/ui components in your Docsframe as usual
---

In addition to the components provided by Docsframe, you can also add external components to enhance the functionality of your documentation.

Some examples of external component libraries that you can use with Docsframe include:

* [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
* [MagicUI](https://magicui.design/) s/o

These libraries provide a wide range of components that you can use to create custom layouts, add interactive elements, and more.

## Usage

For example, to use the `Accordion` component from shadcn/ui, you would install the library using the following command:

<Steps>

###

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add Accordion
```

###

```tsx
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/accordion"
// ... existing imports ...

const components = {
  // ... existing components ...
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
};
```

</Steps>
